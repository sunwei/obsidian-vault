The Pro and Enterprise plans are coming soon! 
We are currently working on finalizing the advanced features for these plans to provide the best experience for our professional and enterprise users. Stay tuned for updates on our website.

##### What happens if I exceed the limits on my plan?

If you exceed the number of deployments or storage space included in your plan, you will be charged according to the additional usage. 
For example, extra deployments will incur a small fee, and storage overages will be billed at a rate specific to your plan. 
You will receive a notification when you're nearing your limits so you can manage your usage.

##### Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan at any time?

Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. 
If you decide to upgrade to a higher plan, the new plan will take effect immediately. 
For downgrades, the changes will apply at the start of the next billing cycle. 
Your usage data (like deployments and storage) will be adjusted accordingly.
