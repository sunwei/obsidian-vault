In this example we will be using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

**Note:** The online reference of
[Supported TeX Functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) is a helpful resource.

### Examples

- Block math:

  $$
  \varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } }
  $$

- Inline math:

  This is an inline polynomial: $5x^2 + 2y -7$.
