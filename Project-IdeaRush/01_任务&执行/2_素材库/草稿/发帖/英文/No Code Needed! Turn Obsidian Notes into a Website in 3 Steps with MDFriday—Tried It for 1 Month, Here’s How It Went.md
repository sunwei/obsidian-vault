Hi everyone! I’ve been an Obsidian user for about 3 months now—mostly using it to organize my coding notes, project docs, and a small personal blog I wanted to share with friends. The problem? I’m terrible at web development. I tried Quartz briefly, but the config files felt overwhelming. Obsidian Publish is easy, but I didn’t want to commit to a monthly subscription just to test if sharing my notes was useful.​

Then I found Friday (by sunwei) in the Obsidian community plugins—and since I only planned to use a plugin for 1 month to test the “notes-to-website” workflow, it turned out to be perfect. I built my first site in 5 minutes, and after a full month of using it, I’m breaking down the exact steps here in case anyone else wants to try it short-term too.​

Step 1: Install MDFriday (1 minutes max-no long-term commitment)​

First, go to your Obsidian settings → Community plugins → Turn off “Safe mode” if it’s on → Search for “Friday” (by sunwei). Click “Install” then “Enable”.​

The best part? If you decide it’s not for you after a month, you can just disable/uninstall it—no leftover files or messy setup to clean up. I tested this myself later, and uninstalling took 10 seconds.​

Step 2: Connect Netlify (2 minute—free for 1 month of testing)​

MDFriday works with Netlify or FTP, but I chose Netlify because its free plan is perfect for a 1-month trial: no credit card needed, and you get a custom subdomain (like yourname.netlify.app) automatically. Here’s how to set it up:​

1. Go to [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) → Sign up with GitHub/email (30 seconds, no credit card).​

2. Back in Obsidian, open Friday’s settings → Publish Method  select “Netlify” → Click “Connect Netlify” → enter your Netlify access and your project id .​

I used this setup for the entire month, and never hit the free plan’s limits—even when I redeployed my notes 5 times .​

Step 3: Publish Your Notes (2 minutes—real-time preview saves time all month)​

What made Friday useful all month (not just once) is the real-time preview. Here’s how I used it for my coding notes:​

1. Right-click my “Coding Tutorials” folder in Obsidian → Select “Publish to web” (you can also publish single notes if you want to test small).​

2. click "Generate Preview"—it will open a new preview page ,every time I edited a note (like adding a code snippet), the preview updated instantly. No waiting, no reloading. This saved me hours over the month because I didn’t have to deploy just to check changes.​

3. When I was ready to share, click “Publish” → 30 seconds later, my site was live. I shared the link with 2 friends, and they could comment on my notes via the website .​

What I Loved Most After 1 Month of Testing​

- No commitment stress: I didn’t have to pay upfront, and uninstalling was easy—perfect for a short trial.​

- Consistent workflow: I used it 2-3 times a week to update my notes, and the process never changed. No new learning curves halfway through the month.​

- Exportable backups: After the month ended, I exported the site’s source code to my computer (1 click "Export Site" in MDFriday settings) so I still have the website if I want to reuse it later.​

I linked my coding tutorial site in the comments—it’s still live from my month of testing! If you’re thinking about trying Friday for a short time (or even just a week), ask me anything—I can help you avoid the small mistakes I made at first.
