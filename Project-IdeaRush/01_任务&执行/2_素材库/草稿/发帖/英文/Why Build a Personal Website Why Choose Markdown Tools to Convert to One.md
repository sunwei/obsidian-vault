Before I get deeper into how I used Friday with Obsidian, a bunch of folks in the community asked me two questions: “I just use note-taking apps to jot stuff down—do I actually need a personal website?” And “Why bother with Markdown tools to build one when there are other platforms out there?”​

Figured I’d break these down with my 1-month trial experience. Might help you decide if this whole “notes-to-website” thing is even worth trying for yourself.​

First: Do You Even Need a Personal Website?​

Not everyone does—but if you’re in one of these groups, it’s way more useful than you might think:​

1. If You Want to “Lock in What You Learn” (Learners, Creators)​

I’d been taking coding notes in Obsidian for 3 months before I turned ’em into a website. At first, I thought “writing ’em down was enough”—but the website totally changed that:​

- It forces you to organize your thoughts: Sorting messy notes into “tutorial sections” or “topic categories” meant I reworked the info in my head, and I remembered it way better afterward.​

- It lets other people benefit: I shared the link in a tech community, and a few folks messaged me saying, “Your notes finally helped me get this concept!” That feeling of helping someone? Way more motivating than just hoarding notes for myself.​

- It’s a low-key portfolio: I’ve seen people slap personal website links on job apps—instead of just saying “I know X,” your notes/docs show you know it. For tech roles especially, that’s way more credible.​

2. If You Need “Simple Sharing” (Professionals, Parents, Hobbyists)​

This is for people who don’t care about “going viral”—just sharing small, meaningful stuff:​

- At work: Turn project plans or meeting notes into a website. Sending a link to clients/teammates is way easier than PDFs (it has search and links!), and you don’t have to resend the whole file every time you edit something.​

- For life: I know someone who made a site for their kid’s growth milestones, and another who organized their travel itinerary. No ads, no weird algorithms—just a link family and friends can click to check it out.​

You don’t need anything fancy here. Friday + Obsidian works perfectly, and a 1-month trial is more than enough to test the waters.​

3. If You Hate “Being Stuck on a Platform”​

Sharing on big platforms (blogs, social media) feels free, but there’s a catch:​

- Your content isn’t yours: If something happens to your account, all that work could vanish.​

- You’re stuck with their design: Wanna change the font or layout? Good luck—most platforms lock that down tight.​

A personal website fixes both. It’s yours: You pick where to host it, how it looks, and no one can take it away. For me, that peace of mind alone was worth trying it.​

Why Use Markdown Tools (Like Obsidian + Friday) to Build It?​

You could use WordPress, Notion, or other blog sites—so why go the Markdown route? It all comes down to ease, speed, and flexibility—especially if you’re not a tech person.​

1. No Coding Required: Write Notes, Build a Site​

I know zilch about web development, but this worked for me:​

- You write like you normally do: Headings with #, lists with -, code with `—all Markdown stuff you’re already using for notes.​

- Skip the tech headaches: No need to learn HTML/CSS, buy a server, or deal with random hoops (like 备案，which is a whole other hassle). Friday turns your Markdown into a website, and Netlify hosts it for free. I didn’t touch a single line of code in my 1-month trial.​

2. Save Time: “Write Once, Update Everywhere”​

With most platforms, you gotta: Write in your note app → Copy-paste to the platform → Fix the formatting that broke. It’s a pain, and you always miss something.​

With Obsidian + Friday? It’s seamless:​

- Edit your note, and the live preview shows you what the website’ll look like right away.​

- Hit “Deploy,” and the site updates in 30 seconds. I edited my notes 8 times in a month, and each update took less than 5 minutes.​

3. Flexibility: Move Your Site Whenever You Want​

This is my favorite part: Markdown content is “portable.”​

- Export the source code: Friday lets you download all the HTML/CSS files with one click. If you ever wanna switch from Netlify to another host (like GitHub Pages), you just upload the files—no starting over from scratch.​

- Markdown works anywhere: If you stop using Obsidian and switch to another note app (Notion, Logseq), your notes still work. No retyping, no formatting disasters.​

4. It’s Cheap (or Free)​

You don’t need to spend money on a website:​

- Storage is free: Your notes live in Obsidian (local or cloud), and Netlify’s free plan gives you 100GB of monthly traffic. I used less than 5GB in a month.​

- No domain fees (unless you want one): Netlify gives you a free subdomain (like yourname.netlify.app). For testing or casual sharing, that’s more than enough.​

A Final Thought: Don’t Overthink It—Just Try It for 1 Month​

If you’re worried “I’ll mess it up” or “It’s too much work,” here’s my advice:​

- Pick 3-5 of your best notes (nothing fancy!) and turn ’em into a site with Friday.​

- Don’t stress about “getting views”—just focus on how it feels to organize your content and own it.​

- If you love it, keep going. If not, uninstall the plugin. No harm, no cost.​

At the end of the day, a personal website isn’t about “having a site”—it’s about making your content work for you. Markdown tools like Obsidian + Friday just make that way easier.​
