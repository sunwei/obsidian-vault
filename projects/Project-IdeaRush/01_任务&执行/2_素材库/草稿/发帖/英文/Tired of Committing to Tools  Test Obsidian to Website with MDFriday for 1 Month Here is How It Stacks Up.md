I’ve seen so many posts here asking: “What’s the best way to share Obsidian notes without long-term commitments?” I had the same question 1 month ago—I wanted to test if sharing my client docs via a website was useful, but didn’t want to pay for Obsidian Publish or spend weeks learning Quartz.​

After 1 month of testing 3 tools, Friday was the clear winner for short-term use. Let me break down why—especially if you only want to use a plugin for a month.​

How the 3 Tools Held Up Over 1 Month of Testing​

I focused on 3 things: ease of setup (for quick testing), utility over 4 weeks, and no “lock-in” when I stopped using them. Here’s the breakdown:​


| Tool​             | Pros for 1-Month Use​                                | Cons for Short-Term Testing​                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Obsidian Publish​ | Super easy to set up (5 minutes)​                    | $10/month—wasting money if you only use it for a month; no exports if you cancel​ |
| Quartz​           | Free, open-source​                                   | Took me 2 hours to set up (config files!); I had to re-learn steps every week​    |
| MDFriday​         | 5-minute setup, real-time preview saves time, free ​ | themes are few (fine for testing)​                                                |

Why Friday Was Best for My 1-Month Trial​

The biggest win was no wasted time. With Quartz, I spent the first 2 hours just getting it to work—and then forgot how to redeploy my notes 2 weeks later (had to rewatch tutorials). With Friday, I set it up once in 5 minutes and used it consistently for the month.​

Another big plus: no “post-trial loss”. When my month ended, I didn’t want to keep using the plugin—but I still had my website. MDFriday lets you export the source code (1 click) so I saved the files to my computer. If I ever want to relaunch the site, I can just upload the files to a host—no need to start over.​

For context: I used it to share client feedback docs for a 4-week project. Every time I updated a note (2-3 times a week), the real-time preview let me check changes fast, and deploying took 30 seconds. My client said it was “way easier than PDFs”—and I didn’t have to pay a cent or commit to anything after the project ended.​

Who Should Test Friday for 1 Month (and Who Shouldn’t)​

Try it if:​

- You have a short project (like a 1-month course, client gig, or event) and need to share notes publicly.​

- You want to test “notes-to-website” without paying or learning code.​

- You hate the idea of wasting time on setup for a tool you might not use long-term.​

Skip it if:​

- You need fancy themes right now (Friday’s dev says 500+ are coming, but basic is fine for testing).​

- You want to publish daily .​

I linked my client doc site in the comments (fake info, don’t worry!)—it’s the exact site I used for the month. If you’re testing Friday short-term, feel free to ask how I maximized the free tier or exported my files—happy to help!
